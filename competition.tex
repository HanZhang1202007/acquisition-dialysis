\begin{frame}{THE EFFECT OF COMPETITION ON FIRM BEHAVIOR}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item investigate whether competition from other dialysis firms can discipline the behavior of newly acquired facilities
        \item defines markets as HSAs (hospital service areas)
        \item uses a Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) to measure concentration
        \item define \textit{post-acquisition HHI} as what the HSAâ€™s HHI would have been in the month before acquisition had the facility already been acquired, to avoid confounding the effect of acquisition with the entry of new dialysis facilities.
    \end{itemize}
