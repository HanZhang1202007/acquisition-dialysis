\begin{frame}{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Research Question:
    
    How do mergers and acquisitions in the healthcare industry, particularly in outpatient dialysis facilities, impact treatment strategies, patient outcomes, and healthcare expenditures?
    \item Motivation:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Healthcare markets are increasingly concentrated due to M\&A
    \item While previous studies have explored associations between market structure and outcomes, there's a lack of understanding regarding the specific mechanisms driving changes in outcomes post-acquisition.
    \item This research aims to fill this gap by examining large chains implement their strategies in acquired facilities and leverage economies of scale to influence care quality and costs.
