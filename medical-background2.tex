\begin{frame}{Medical Background}
A dialysis facilityâ€™s quality of care may be assessed through \textbf{clinical indicators} and \textbf{patient outcomes}.

Clinical Indicators for Dialysis Facility Quality:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Urea Reduction Ratio (URR): Measures waste filtration during dialysis.
    \item Hemoglobin (Hgb) Levels: Indicates anemia severity.
\end{itemize}

Patient Outcomes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mortality and hospitalization rates.
    \item especially septicemia (which can be reduced by properly cleaning machines) and cardiovascular (events exacerbated by excessive EPO use)
\end{itemize}
