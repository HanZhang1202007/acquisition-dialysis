\begin{frame}{PREACQUISITION DIFFERENCES ACROSS CHAIN AND INDEPENDENT FACILITIES}
why independent facilities do not imitate the behavior of the more profitable chain facilities before acquisition?

estimate the impact of an acquisition on total variable profits per dialysis session and several variables related to EPO
    $$Y_{jt} = \beta_{pre}D^{Pre}_{jt} + \beta_{post}D^{post}_{jt} + \beta_{chain}D^{chain}_{jt} + \alpha X_{jt} + \epsilon_{jt} $$
