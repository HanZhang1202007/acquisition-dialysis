% $IncreasesHHI_j$ : dummy if the acquisition of facility $j$ increased HHI. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the outcomes in markets where an acquisition increased concentration do not differ from those where an acquisition did not
        \item therefore, the decrease in quality of care occurs through the transference of firm strategy, not an increase in market power.
