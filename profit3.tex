\begin{frame}{PREACQUISITION DIFFERENCES ACROSS CHAIN AND INDEPENDENT FACILITIES}

Profit Composition at Acquired Facilities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Majority of per-session profit increase at acquired facilities attributed to EPO.
    \item Chains pay lower prices for EPO due to negotiated volume discounts with drug suppliers-- scale economies from buyer power not available to smaller independent facilities.
\end{itemize}

Objectives and Incentives:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Chains may prioritize financial performance over patient outcomes.
\end{itemize}

Risks and Financial Reserves:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Chains may accept risks on patient care due to financial reserves to cover litigation costs, highlighted by instances of large settlements by chains like DaVita.
\end{itemize}
