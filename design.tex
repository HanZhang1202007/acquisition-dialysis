\begin{frame}{THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS }
    difference-in-differences research design that compares independent facilities acquired by chains to those that are never acquired:
    $$Y_{ijt} = \beta_{pre}D^{Pre}_{jt} + \beta_{post}D^{post}_{jt} + \beta_{chain}D^{chain}_{jt} + \alpha X_{ijt} + \epsilon_{ijt} $$

\begin{itemize}
    \item $Y_{ijt}$ is the outcome of interest for patient $i$ at facility $j$ in month $t$;
    \item $D_{pre}$ and $D_{Post}$ are indicators for whether facility $j$ in
month $t$ will be acquired in the future or has already been acquired;
    \item $D_{Chain}$ is an indicator for whether facility j is always owned by a chain.
\end{itemize}

To avoid measurement error in the date of acquisition and to allow enough time for a firmâ€™s strategy to be fully implemented, exclude all observations within a six-month window on either side of the acquisition date.
