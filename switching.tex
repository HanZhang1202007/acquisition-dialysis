    \begin{itemize}
        \item standard models of competition with endogenous provider quality predict that quality will increase with competition, assuming that demand increases with product quality
        \item In practice, patient demand in the U.S. dialysis market does not respond to the decline in quality following an acquisition
        \item may be due to a lack of options and travel cost
